## Description
This project is a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot prototype built using **OpenAI models** and **Google Colab**.  
It demonstrates how to integrate document retrieval with generative AI to provide context-aware, factual responses.  
The project serves as a foundation for developing **intelligent reading assistants** that can answer students' questions over lessons and knowledge bases.


## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines semantic search and OpenAIâ€™s large language models.  
- **Custom Knowledge Integration:** Upload and query your own text, PDFs, or datasets.  
- **Google Colab Compatible:** Easy to run and modify in a Colab environment.  
- **Prototype for Research:** Ideal for experimentation and learning about RAG systems.


## tools
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenAI API**  
- **ChromaDB**  
- **Google Colab environment**
