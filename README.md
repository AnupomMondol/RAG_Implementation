#Description
ColabRAG is a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot prototype built using OpenAI models and Google Colab.
It demonstrates how to integrate document retrieval with generative AI to provide context-aware, factual responses. The project serves as a foundation for developing intelligent reading assistants that can answer a student's questions over lesson and knowledge bases.

#Features

Custom Knowledge Integration: Upload and query your own text, PDFs, or datasets.
Google Colab Compatible: Easy to run and modify in a Colab environment.
Prototype for Research: Ideal for experimentation and learning about RAG systems.
